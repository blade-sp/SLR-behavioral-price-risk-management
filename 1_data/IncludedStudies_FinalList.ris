AB  - Incorporation of futures markets into the theory of the firm under uncertainty has received considerable attention in risk management. A theoretical model of optimal firm decisions in cash and futures markets considering price, production, and financial risks is presented. Production and marketing strategies for corn and soybeans in Georgia and Illinois are analyzed to determine the optimal amount of futures contracting which may be a hedge or a speculative position. A partial hedge is optimal for most situations for risk averse producers when the amount hedged is variable. With fixed quantity transactions, speculative and cash positions, but not hedging, tend to be E-V efficient.

AB  - A survey of Kansas, Texas, and Iowa agricultural producers was taken to examine the factors affecting their grain marketing practices. Sales indices models and models of qualitative choice are used to determine whether marketers' choices of cash market, forward contract, or futures and options oriented marketing practices are significantly affected by their personal and farm business characteristics. Results indicate that geographic location, farm size, grain enterprise specialization, farming experience, use of grain storage, and use of crop insurance have significant effects upon the respondents' choice of grain marketing practices.

TI  - Dairy farmer use of price risk management tools
AU  - Wolf, C.A.
T2  - Journal of Dairy Science
AB  - Volatility in milk and feed prices can adversely affect dairy farm profitability. Many risk management tools are available for use by US dairy farmers. This research uses surveys of Michigan dairy farmers to examine the extent to which price risk management tools have been used, the farm and operator characteristics that explain the use of these tools, and reasons farmers have not used these tools. A 1999 survey was used to benchmark the degree to which dairy producers had used milk and feed price risk management instruments to compare with 2011 use rates. The surveys collected information about the farm characteristics such as herd size, farmland operated, business organization, and solvency position. Farm operator characteristics collected include age, education, and experience. Dairy farmer use of both milk and feed price risk management tools increased between 1999 and 2011. In 2011, herd size was positively related to the use of milk price risk management tools, whereas farms organized as a sole proprietorship were less likely to use them. Also in 2011, herd size and land operated were positively related to feed price risk management tools, whereas operator age was negatively related. Reasons why farmers had not used price risk management tools included basis risk, cost, lack of management time, cooperative membership, and lack of understanding. Conclusions include the need for educational programming on price risk management tools and a broader exploration of dairy farm risk management programs.

T2  - Journal of Agricultural & Food Industrial Organization
AB  - In this paper we estimate the farmers’ side welfare effects of a hypothetical regulatory scenario that would partially eliminate production contracts in the hog industry. Using the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data for 2004, farmers’ production costs under different marketing arrangements are estimated and then used to recover their individual risk aversion parameters with the help of a structural expected proﬁt maximization model. The results show that farmers who use production contracts are more risk averse than farmers who use spot markets or marketing contracts. The regulation that forces producers to market their hogs in a riskier marketing channel relative to the channel they themselves selected imposes large welfare losses on the affected farmers.

It derives the demand for hedging as a function of the price of a hedge and the crop choice set; it estimates these functions for California cotton farmers. It finds that both the costs of hedging and the opportunity to diversify risk by growing other crops substantially change the optimal hedge for California cotton farmers.

AB  - Abstract
            Individual risk preferences can have important implications for commodity hedging decisions. Existing literature suggests that when cash and futures positions are treated as endogenous, the optimal hedge ratio is independent of the risk parameter. Under similar conditions we demonstrate that the existence of nonlinear transaction or storage costs makes the decision maker's attitude toward risk a relevant determinant of the size of the optimal hedge ratio.

AU  - Brorsen, B. Wade
T2  - American Journal of Agricultural Economics
AB  - A new theory of hedging is derived assuming producers are risk neutral, forward pricing is costly, and borrowing costs are nonlinear. The standard risk-minimizing hedge ratio is derived when forward pricing is costless. When the assumption of costless hedging is dropped, high-leveraged firms are shown to hedge more than do low-leveraged firms. If the value of capital is uncorrelated with output price, firms are shown to hedge more as cash price variability increases. Thus, the model can be consistent with what firms actually do.

Producers who forward priced during the 1995-1998 period generally expected to forward price in 1999 using similar techniques. Probit models were estimated for cash forward contracts and taking a direct position in futures or options separately and combined. Results provide limited support for the hypothesis that forward pricing should be analyzed as an adoption decision. Variables reflecting risk attitudes do affect the decision to use forward pricing, while variables related to economic position affect the level of forward pricing.

AB  - Among dealers in the physical commodity, the benefits associated with risk reduction are important factors in motivating the decision to engage in futures trading. Although it is possible to evaluate, in an objective sense, the ability of a market to reduce risk, actual and potential users may also be heavily influenced by their subjective assessments of the performance and reliability of a futures market. This paper argues that the recent decline in the level of usage of the London Potato Futures Market may be more the product of unfavourable attitudes to trading than of a decline in the performance of the market with respect to risk reduction.

AB  - Research offers mixed evidence about the risk management decision-making process of producers. Whether producers’ characteristics drive behavior directly or through risk attitude remains a puzzle. We assess whether managerial/ﬁrm characteristics directly affect choices or if their inﬂuence occurs indirectly through impacts on risk attitude. The ﬁndings, which support indirect effects, indicate that failure to represent relationships between risk attitude, other characteristics, and behavior appropriately can mask the effect of risk attitude. A more complete understanding of the structure of decision-making may assist economists, policymakers, and industry stakeholders in designing and targeting mechanisms to manage or transfer risk.

            Attitudes of peanut producers toward different market alternatives were analyzed assuming the absence of the government support program. A multivariate probit (joint estimation) model for ungrouped data was utilized to ascertain profiles of producers favoring private treaty markets and proposed organized markets. The joint estimation model allows for and measures correlation among market alternatives for greater accuracy in profile analysis. The analysis suggests considerable support for all three of the proposed organized markets. However, choice of alternatives should be considered by a group of potential traders selected on the basis of the profile analysis.

Tobit models are employed to evaluate individual levels of adoption of these techniques in the marketing of wheat, corn, grain sorghum, soybeans, and cattle.

AU  - Grant, Dwight
AB  - Expected utility maximizing farmers facing just price risk or both price risk and quantity risk behave similady in the absence of a forward market. If forward contracting is possible, that is not true because variation in the commodity price affects a farmer's wealth through the value of his futures position, the value of his output and through the covariance between price and output. This covariance affects a farmer' s optimal scale of production, his optimal forward position and the interrelationship between the scale of production and forward trading.

AB  - This paper analyzes production, hedging, and speculative decisions when both futures and options can be used in an expected utility model of price and basis uncertainty. When futures and option prices are unbiased, optimal hedging requires only futures (options are redundant). Options are used together with futures as speculative tools when market prices are perceived as biased. Straddles are used to speculate on beliefs about price volatility and to hedge the futures position used to speculate on beliefs about the expected value of the futures price. Mean-variance analysis in general is not consistent with expected utility when options are allowed.

AB  - We consider the hedging problem of a firm that has three sources of risk: price, basis, and yield uncertainty. An exact solution for the optimal futures hedge is derived under the assumption that the three random variables are jointly normally distributed and that utility is of the CARA type. Unlike the mean-variance approximation applied in previous research, we show that the optimal hedge does depend on risk attitudes, even when the agent perceives the futures price as being unbiased. The theoretical results are applied empirically to the problem of hedging soybean production in Iowa. The exact solution, relying on CARA and normality, is compared with numerical solutions under lognormal distributions and CRRA utility.

            Decision making under unknown true parameters (estimation risk) is discussed along with Bayes' and parameter certainty equivalent (PCE) criteria. Bayes' criterion incorporates estimation risk in a manner consistent with expected utility maximization. The PCE method, which is the most commonly used, is not consistent with expected utility maximization. Bayes' criterion is employed to solve for the minimum‐variance hedge ratio. Empirical application of Bayes' minimum‐variance hedge ratio is addressed and illustrated. Simulations show that discrepancies between prior and sample parameters may lead to substantial differences between Bayesian and PCE minimum‐variance hedges.

            This note examines the effect of loss aversion on the futures trading behavior of a short hedger.

AB  - Increasing grain price volatility over the last year has revived the discussion on optimal marketing strategies. Various models of optimal grain marketing have been proposed and simulated in the literature. In this study, an overview of these models is presented and critical aspects are discussed. Optimal strategies are then applied to the wheat market in Germany and Poland. The results show that gains from optimal marketing are rather small and uncertain in the real world, indicating that scientific assistance may be of limited importance when using only publicly available information. However, an understanding of optimization and price-generating processes is likely to improve farmers’ decisions – in particular when additional (private) information to improve price forecasts is available.

T2  - European Review of Agriculture Economics
AB  - The demand for hedging against price uncertainty in the presence of crop yield and revenue insurance contracts is examined for French wheat farms. The rationale for the use of options in addition to futures is ﬁrst highlighted through the characterisation of the ﬁrst-best hedging strategy in the expected utility framework. It is then illustrated using numerical simulations. Futures and crop yield insurance are shown to be complements, whereas futures and crop revenue insurance are substitutes. The presence of options induces the insured producer to adopt a more speculative position on the futures market. Futures and options would improve the producer’s welfare, in terms of willingness to receive.

T2  - Journal of Financial Markets
AB  - We analyze how the introduction of probability weighting and loss aversion in a futures hedging model affects decision making. Analytical ﬁndings indicate that probability weighting alone always affects optimal hedge ratios, while loss and risk aversion only have an impact when probability weighting exists. In the presence of probability weighting, simulation results for a relevant range of parameter values suggest that probability weighting is dominant; changes in probability weighting affect hedge ratios relatively more than changes in loss and risk aversion. When decisions are made independently, loss aversion has a relatively small impact on hedge ratios for all parameter values, and risk aversion becomes important for only a narrow range of risk coefﬁcients which produce implausible speculative behavior. When prior losses and gains affect behavior, hedging is inﬂuenced most by prior outcomes that inﬂuence risk attitudes, but this effect is still somewhat less than the consequences of changes in probability weighting.

AB  - This study aimed to explore how producers’ reference prices are formed and adapt over time, and how they affect marketing decisions. Results indicate that producers focus on three major variables to form their reference prices: the current market price, the highest price to date, and their expectation about price behavior. Further, they update their reference prices during the marketing season mainly in response to changes in current market prices, their own expectations about price behavior, and the general price trend. Finally, our ﬁndings suggest that producers’ marketing decisions are based on the spread between current market price and reference price, the general market trend and price expectation.

In an application to cattle feedlot operations, our objective is to determine if producers view output price and animal health risks separately or jointly. We conduct a survey with a choice experiment placing operators in forward looking, decision-making scenarios, and capture information on past risk management approaches. Evidence regarding a relationship between animal health and output price risk mitigation is mixed and depends on the decision being made. Combined, these results provide new insight into how managers approach multiple risks when facing resource constraints.

Using a logit model and farmlevel data, this analysis estimates the effect of factors on the probability of a producer using forward input contracting. Results suggest that use of contracting in selling of crops and livestock, technology, farm size, geographic location, participation in government commodity programs, and use of extension services are important factors affecting the choice to forward contract inputs.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the minimum level of contract payments required to produce hogs under a production contract. Required payments needed for contract growing to be preferred to independent production for the average‐profit, slightly risk‐averse, feeder‐pig producer and for the high‐profit, moderately to strongly risk‐averse, feeder‐pig producer are found to be similar to those currently offered by contractors. Feeder‐pig finishers with average profit levels would either have to be strongly risk‐averse or expect economic profits to fall to zero to prefer contracting over independent production. Low‐profit feeder‐pig finishers who are moderately to strongly risk‐averse would prefer contracting. Feeder‐pig finishers who historically have experienced above‐average profits would require payments substantially above current contract rates to prefer contracting.

Quant aux engraisseurs à niveau de profit moyen, il faudrait soit qu'il soit complètement ennemi du risque ou qu'ils envisagent que leur rentabilité puisse descendre à zéro pour les inciter à produire ous‐contrat. En revanche les engraisseurs à faible niveau de rentabilité et modérément à fortement soucieux des risques préféreraient la production sous‐contrat.

AB  - We investigate factors that drive derivative usage in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The inﬂuence of these factors on hedging behavior cannot a priori be assumed equal for all SMEs. To address this heterogeneity, a generalized mixture regression model is used which classiﬁes ﬁrms into segments, so that the hedging response to the determinants of derivative usage is the same within each segment. Using a unique data set of 415 SMEs, containing both accounting and experimental data, we ﬁnd that factors like risk exposure, risk perception, risk attitude, and the decision-making unit, among others are useful in explaining hedging behavior. However, the eﬀects of these factors are not homogeneous across all managers, and the roots of the heterogeneity can partially be traced to diﬀerences in attitudes, perceptions, and to diﬀerences in ownership structure.

AB  - Channel contract relations are dynamic. In this paper, it is argued that one of the drivers for this dynamism is a firm’s strive for shareholder value. Using channel contract relationships as market-based assets, firms are managing a portfolio of spot and forward contract relationships. By exclusively focusing on the cash flow consequences of contract relationships, in the context of an industrial marketing channel, we introduce a decision-oriented, normative, multichannel dyadic model that shows how channel contract relationships interact, thereby explaining the various contract relationships that exist and the dynamics within these relationships. The model transforms top management’s financial objectives into marketing management decisions and guides the decision process of channel members in optimizing the cash flow consequences of channel contract relationships. The properties of the model are illustrated for the meat departments of European retailers.

AB  - We use a stated preference instrument to elicit producer preferences for the attributes of risk-shifting hog marketing contracts and express acceptable producer trade-offs between contract attributes in a convenient dollar metric. Respondents value an increase in a window contract’s price ceiling three to ﬁve times more than the same increase in the price ﬂoor, which suggests that hog producers dislike contracts that limit up-side price potential (limit positive skewness). The contractor’s organizational form is also important. Cooperative forms are preferred by many respondents, particularly those who state that trust in the contractor is an important antecedent for any contractual relationship.

AU  - Shi, Wei

T2  - American Journal of Agricultural Economics
AB  - The standard optimal hedging model has been the preferred theoretical model of normative hedging behavior. In empirical applications, the model is often implemented with the parameter certainty equivalent (PCE) procedure. However, the PCE procedure completely ignores parameter estimation risk and subjective views. We develop an “empirical” Bayesian optimal hedging model that not only effectively accommodates parameter estimation risk, but also provides hedgers with a theoretically intuitive yet quantitatively rigorous framework to blend their subjective views and a “marketwide” or “ﬁrmwide” consensus in determining optimal hedging positions (ratios).

AB  - United States cattle producers have various government-sponsored programs to protect against weather and disease related risks, but livestock risk protection (LRP) insurance is the only program that protects against price risk. However, adoption of LRP insurance is low even though cattle price declines are the primary cause of economic loss, and LRP premium subsidies have recently been increased. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore how informational nudges about receiving an indemnity payment, LRP contract characteristics, and individual risk preferences affect the use of LRP. Producer survey results were estimated using a Cragg model to determine the factors affecting producers’ likelihood of purchasing LRP and the number of head they would insure. Producers were more likely to purchase 100% LRP coverage and would also insure more head at 100% coverage when compared to lower coverage levels. We found providing information on the probability of receiving an indemnity did not impact LRP purchasing decisions. However, counter to expectations, producers were more likely to buy LRP when the randomly provided cattle prices in the survey were successively increasing each month, and if participants considered themselves more willing to take risks in their cattle operation. Results provide insights into behavioral factors affecting LRP participation which could help inform future insurance policies. © 2024 The Authors.

T2  - Agricultural Economics (United Kingdom)
AB  - We identify factors involved in the decision of farmers to use marketing contracts (pool, storage and forward contracts), and we explicitly account for the hedging and price-enhancement components of this decision. Using panel corner solution models (Tobit and double-hurdle) to represent farmers’ contracting decision using a sample of French cereal producers, we find that both the hedging and the price-enhancement motives are important factors driving marketing choices. When risk aversion or exposure to price risk rises, the price-enhancement motive becomes less influential. Farmers appear to be more reluctant to base their marketing decisions on their price expectations in that case. © 2021 International Association of Agricultural Economists

AU  - Jacobs, K.L.

T2  - American Journal of Agricultural Economics
AB  - We develop a theoretical model of optimal hedging that nests expected utility and expected target utility theories. We use this model to characterize optimal hedging with and without reference price dependence. The model’s theoretical predictions are tested with a unique database consisting of every forward contract written with a major grain marketing firm by Iowa corn producers over a five-year period. Our results suggest that a current December futures price higher than a reference price triggers hedging activity. A likely candidate for producers’ reference price is a rolling average of the current futures price. We then use trading activity implied by the producers to determine if they benefit from the way they hedge. The evidence is mixed. Finally, we compare the producer forward contract data to the only publicly available data on producer hedging: The Commodity Futures Trading Commission Disaggregated Commitment of Traders Report (DCOT) for Short Hedgers. A hedge ratio constructed from the open interest in new futures contracts of the DCOT report is highly correlated with the producer hedge series in the Iowa data, providing evidence that DCOT data represent farmers’ hedging behavior reasonably well. This work has important implications for future research that uses the DCOT data, and provides new evidence about producers’ hedging behavior that marketing specialists and extension agents can use to enhance their educational efforts related to risk management. © The Author(s) 2018.

T2  - Agricultural Finance Review
AB  - Purpose: Adoption rates of commodity futures contracts among farmers are rather low in Europe despite their political support. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) can contribute to the understanding of farmers’ intention to use commodity futures contracts. Here, the authors explicitly distinguish between usage motives for price risk reduction and speculation. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on an online survey with 134 German farmers using partial least squares structural equation modeling to estimate the TAM. Findings: The intention to use commodity futures contracts is mostly driven by farmers’ motivation for speculation rather than price risk reduction. Assuming risk averse farmers, this result could explain low adoption rates. Furthermore, perceived ease of use has a positive effect on the intention to use commodity futures contracts. Practical implications: Handling of price hedging instruments should be facilitated to increase farmers’ adoption. Effective marketing trainings, which can demonstrate the ability of commodity futures contracts to reduce price risk, could increase farmers’ motivation to use them for their risk management instead of speculation. Originality/value: This study analyzes path relationships between constructs expected to influence the intention to use commodity futures contracts which are allowed to be estimated by the TAM in one model. Here, the authors explicitly distinguish between usage motives for price risk reduction and speculation. This is the first study applying the TAM to price risk management tools. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - We study the optimal hedging decisions for a risk-averse salmon producer. The hedging decisions are determined using a multistage stochastic programming model. The objective is to maximize the weighted sum of expected revenues from selling salmon either in the spot market or in futures contracts and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of the revenues over the planning horizon. The scenario tree for the multistage stochastic programming model is generated based on a procedure that combines Principal Component Analysis and state space modelling. We present results for 3 different CVaR percentiles and different degrees of risk-aversion. The results indicate that salmon producers should use futures contracts to hedge price risk already at fairly low degrees of risk-aversion. The methods described in this paper will be useful as a decision support tool for determining fish companies' risk management and hedging strategies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - French specialized durum wheat farmers are subject to market risks (price volatility), production risks (fluctuating quality and yields), and an increasingly restrictive regulatory environment (limits on inputs). The purpose of this paper is to gain a more in-depth understanding of the strategies used by those farmers to manage these risks by analysing portfolio strategies in marketing methods and in production decisions. The findings show that three main categories of marketing methods can be adopted in different proportions: forward contracts, average price contracts and spot market selling. A hundred farmers are surveyed in South-West France. An empirical analysis of the determinants of their marketing methods show that risk perceptions and the farmer's level of education influence the choice to sign a preharvest contract for part of their production. In addition, agricultural diversification is negatively correlated with the choice to use forward contracts to hedge against market risk.

AB  - This paper analyses the influencing factors of farmers' use of price hedging instruments (PHIs) based upon a discrete choice experiment with German grain farmers. A mixed logit model is used to determine whether farmers' choices of PHIs against cash sales are influenced by their price expectation, their risk attitude and their available storage capacities. The results show that farmers with a price expectation below the actual price level have a higher preference for using PHIs against cash sales in general and that the individual degree of risk aversion can have a significant impact on farmers' choices of a specific PHI. A generally lower preference of farmers with available storage capacities for using PHIs as assumed in many theoretical contributions in the literature, however, cannot be confirmed. © De Gruyter 2014.

AB  - Numerous crop marketing and risk management tools are available. Research relating producers' risk attitudes to their use of these tools has produced mixed results, and most studies focus on individual tools, neglecting potential complementarities in information they provide. Little is known about the proportion in which individual tools are used, e.g., the percentage of the crop that is forward sold as opposed to hedged. This study identifies factors, including risk attitude, that impact the proportion of corn and soybean producers' sales through spot markets, futures, and options, as well as forward and production contracts, and investigates contract complementarity and substitutability using survey and accounting data, and causal modeling. © 2012 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Factors affecting the use of forward pricing methods in price risk management with special reference to the influence of risk aversion
AU  - Jordaan, H.
AU  - Grové, H.
T2  - Agrekon
AB  - Risk aversion is the primary reason for farmers to use forward pricing methods to hedge against price risk. Previous international research on farmers' forward pricing behaviour found inconsistent results with respect to the relationship between risk aversion and the use of forward pricing methods. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is used in this research to investigate the relationship between the proportion of maize Vaalharts maize producers are willing to forward price and risk aversion. The quantity decision is modelled conditional on the adoption decision to ensure that the modelling procedure does not force the same variables to influence the two decisions in the same way. Regression results showed that more risk averse farmers are forward pricing a larger proportion of their crop produce. The main conclusion from this research is that the relationship between farmers' risk aversion and the quantity of maize forward priced is consistent with expected utility theory in spite of the fact that farmers needs to be less risk averse to adopt forward pricing. Future emphases should be placed on the factors affecting the adoption of forward pricing as risk management tool in order to promote risk management. Especially research that will change farmers' perception about forward pricing is necessary.

AB  - This article offers a comprehensive analysis of the problem of choosing between alternative market risk management instruments. We model farmers' behavior to optimize the certainty equivalent, formulated by a mean-variance model, by combining instruments with and without basis risk. Results are expressed as the demands for hedging with futures, forward contracts and insurance. Theoretical results are applied to a selection of Spanish producers of fresh potatoes, a sector that is exposed to significant market risks. Amsterdam's Euronext provides potato futures prices, and the recently launched revenue insurance in Spain provides the example for price insurance. Three conclusions summarize the article's main findings. First, we show that Spanish potato revenue insurance subsidies are a factor that determines the instrument rankings and choice. Second, the efficiency of insurance subsidies is generally low. Finally, the Amsterdam potato futures market does not provide a cost-effective means to manage price risks for Spanish fresh potato growers. © 2007 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - Risk reduction and transaction costs are often used to explain contracting in the U.S. hog industry with little empirical support. Using a unified conceptual framework that draws from risk behavior and transaction cost theories, in combination with unique survey and accounting data, we demonstrate that risk preferences and asset specificity impact Illinois producers' use of contracts and spot markets. In particular, producers' investments in specific hog genetics and human capital are related to selection of long-term marketing contracts over spot markets. Producers who perceive greater levels of price risk and/or are more averse are more (less) likely to use contracts (spot markets). © 2009 Western Agricultural Economics Association.

AB  - The use by farmers of futures contracts and other hedging instruments has been observed to be low in many situations, and this has sometimes seemed to be considered surprising or even mysterious. We propose that it is, in fact, readily understandable and consistent with rational decision making. Standard models of the decision about optimal hedging show that it is negatively related to basis risk, to quantity risk, and to transaction costs. Farmers who have less uncertainty about prices and those with a diversified portfolio of investments have lower optimal levels of hedging. If a farmer has optimistic price expectations relative to the futures market, the incentive to hedge can be greatly reduced. And finally, farmers who have low levels of risk aversion have little to gain from hedging in terms of risk reduction, in that the certainty-equivalent payoff at their optimal hedge may be little different than the certainty equivalent under zero hedging. These reasons are additional to the argument of Simmons (2002) who showed that, if capital markets are efficient, farmers can manage their risk exposure through adjusting their leverage, obviating the need for hedging instruments. © 2008 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AU  - Liu, X.

T2  - Agricultural and Food Science
AB  - This paper estimates optimal hedging ratios for a Finnish spring wheat producer under price and yield uncertainty. The contract available for hedging fixes the price and quantity at the time of sowing for a delivery at harvest. Autoregressive models are used to obtain point forecasts for the conditional mean price and price volatility at harvest. Expected yield and yield volatility are estimated from the field experiment data. A range of coefficients of absolute risk aversion are used in the computations. The results suggest that yield volatility is large and it dominates the price volatility in the optimal hedging decisions of the Finnish wheat producers. The point estimate for the price and yield correlation is negative and has a large magnitude. Thus, a negative correlation between the price and the yield, as signalled by the point estimate, will decrease the optimal hedging ratio since the Finnish farmers do not have access to selling put options when they enter in a forward contract. © Agricultural and Food Science.

AB  - Risk-averse farmers in the produce industry grow a product whose market price is often quite unpredictable. Shippers or other intermediaries shield the farmer from much of this price risk; however, actual contracts between growers and shippers vary considerably across commodities in the residual price risk growers face. We hypothesize that imperfect quality measurement results in a moral hazard problem, and that price provides additional information regarding quality. As a consequence, an efficient contract does not shield growers from all idiosyncratic price risk. We examine this hypothesis for the case of fresh-market tomatoes.

T2  - American Journal of Agricultural Economics
AB  - The relationship between farmers' behavioral attitudes and use of futures contracts is examined, taking into account non-directly observable variables and the heterogeneity of farmers. The relationships are tested on a stratified data sample of 440 farmers. Cluster analysis and covariance structure equation models are used to validate the relationships. Farmers are found not to be homogenous regarding the factors influencing their use of futures. Heterogeneity at the segment level masked important effects at the aggregate level, notably risk attitude. Furthermore, several psychological constructs for farmers related to market orientation, risk exposure, market performance and entrepreneurial behavior play important roles in their use of futures contracts.

AB  - A survey of cotton producers was conducted in Mississippi and Texas. The econometric model consists of a multinomial logit model of cotton producers’ choice of marketing techniques. The results indicate that cotton acres positively influence pooling and negatively influence cash sales. Producers willing to incur higher transaction costs in market information systems and training tend to choose futures/options contracts and forward pricing. It was found that risk-averse producers tend not to choose pooling contracts. On the other hand, producers who seek abnormal gains through speculation tend to choose pooling contracts. Finally, producers who perceive markets as being price-efficient prefer cash sales. [EconLit citation: Q130.] © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Agribusiness 20: 465-479, 2004.

AB  - The potential for hedging Australian wheat with the new Sydney Futures Exchange wheat contract is examined using a theoretical hedging model parametised from previous studies. The optimal hedging ratio for an 'average' wheat farmer was found to be zero under reasonable assumptions about transaction costs and based on previously published measures of risk aversion. The estimated optimal hedging ratios were found by simulation to be quite sensitive to assumptions about the degree of risk aversion. If farmers are significantly more risk averse than is currently believed, then there is likely to be an active interest in the new futures market.

AB  - This study provides additional evidence of the usefulness of mean-variance procedures in the presence of options which can truncate and skew the returns distribution. Using a simulation analysis, price hedging decisions are examined for hog producers when options are available. Mean-variance results are contrasted with optimal decisions based on negative exponential and Cox-Rubinstein utility functions over 56 ending price scenarios and two levels of risk aversion. The findings from our simulation, which considers discrete contracts, basis risk, lognormality in prices, transactions costs, and alternative utility specifications, affirm the usefulness of the mean-variance framework.

AB  - Despite extensive study, researchers continue to search for consistent and reliable measures of risk preferences to explain market behavior. We find that a measure, combining experiments rooted in expected utility theory and measures derived from surveys, explains spot and contractual sales, but does not exhibit substantially greater explanatory power than its underlying components. Survey-based measures are generally more significant indicators of marketing choices, but experimental measures reveal how risk attitudes vary over a range of probable outcomes, which is important in light of increased commodity price volatility. Given recently identified limitations on the applicability of expected utility theory, we suggest that researchers include survey methods to obtain low-cost supplemental measures.

AU  - Vyn, RJ
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D AGROECONOMIE
AB  - Marketing decisions can be some of the most difficult decisions facing grain and oilseed producers. There is a lack of information about the marketing strategies that are most effective, and there is also a lack of consensus in the literature about whether some types of marketing strategies can consistently perform better than others. This paper uses a simulation model based on daily cash and futures prices to compare returns and risk over time from specific marketing strategies for corn and soybean producers in Ontario. This paper also examines whether there are differences in the relative effectiveness of strategies between higher-price years and lower-price years. The results indicate that preharvest marketing strategies for both corn and soybeans tend to generate prices that are much higher than selling everything at harvest (the baseline strategy), particularly for the higher-price years; however, these differences are not always statistically significant. Preharvest strategies are also found to reduce downside risk relative to the baseline.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the relation between hedging activity by commercial/merchant/producers to commodity prices and commodity market volatility using Commitments of Traders reports from commodity futures markets exchanges. Qualifying the body of literature which attributes hedging activity to departures from Modigliani-Miller theory, market imperfections and transactions cost, we address the paradoxes of hedging which is not value creating and the absence of hedging when firms might benefit, arguing that it may be related to the market conditions and risk appetite. We discover that prices and volatility are generally statistically significant contributors to hedging activity by commercial/merchant/producers’ users but with marked differences in their elasticities. For some commodities, price levels alone and not volatility are significant. We demonstrate that analysis of hedging in commodity markets should take cognisance of conditions and the degree of risk aversion, otherwise the implicit assumption is that hedging is invariant to such matters. Through considering both market conditions and the degree of risk aversion, understanding the motivation for hedging may be enhanced. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AU  - Gohin, A.

T2  - Journal of Policy Modeling
AB  - Over the last 30 years, the European Union has significantly reformed its Common Agricultural Policy by introducing direct payments to farmers and reducing price support levels. While the European agricultural prices become more volatile, all economic models assessing these reforms remain static and ignore the risk dimensions. This paper develops an original stochastic computable general equilibrium model capturing the different sources of risk, farmers’ risk attitude and risk contingent markets. We find that the reduction of price support levels has modest market impacts but negative global welfare effects by exposing risk-averse European farmers to the world price volatility. This issue is not solved by the direct payments, which have negligible market and global welfare impacts through their wealth effects. On the other hand, we find that unbiased futures markets can solve this global welfare issue by allowing European farmers to transfer their price risks. Therefore, European policymakers should ensure well-functioning risk contingent markets rather than maintaining rigid intervention price levels. © 2020 The Society for Policy Modeling

T2  - Agricultural Finance Review
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the relationships between grain farm and farmer profiles and their respective choices to use forward pricing techniques and revenue protection crop insurance to manage risk. Design/methodology/approach: An e-mail survey of Midwestern grain farmers elicited farmer demographic information, farm profile, risk attitudes and farmer use of forward pricing and revenue protection insurance. Responses regarding use of risk management tools were compiled as choices to use possible bundles of tools to account for simultaneous nature of the decision. Choices to use bundles of tools were used as the independent variable categories in a multinomial logit regression. Regressors were relevant data collected from the survey. Findings: Farm size, using a market advisory service, and being a technology adopter are the most important factors in predicting risk management tool use by grain farmers. Farmers tend to use forward pricing and revenue protection insurance in combination. Large farms are more likely to use forward pricing tools. Practical implications: Results provide researchers, extension professionals and risk management specialists with a current understanding of how farm and farmer characteristics relate to use of risk management tools. The authors also elaborate on findings to provide guidance for future risk management research. Originality/value: The survey covered 9 Midwestern states and 648 grain farmers. The survey results update understanding of grain farmers’ risk management practices. The empirical approach treats risk management decisions to use available tools as simultaneous, which recent literature suggests is more appropriate than earlier approaches. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Insurance prospects after the European dairy quota abolition
AU  - Schulte, H.

T2  - Agricultural Finance Review
AB  - Purpose: The expected increase in milk price volatility after the milk quota abolition in the EU will lead to further planning uncertainty on dairy farms. Consequently, the modest supply of insurance and the hedging of milk prices through futures may increase. To shed more light on this possibility, the purpose of this paper is to calculate the additional willingness to pay (WTP) for risk-averse dairy farmers in order to cope with milk price volatility after the quota abolition. Design/methodology/approach: After the European dairy quota abolition, European dairy farmers will be more dependent on the milk price of the world market. To reflect the world market, a time series of milk prices of a dairy processor from New Zealand (NZ) was used because NZ is exporting most of their dairy products under world market conditions. Based on the NZ price series, we approximated milk price volatility after the European dairy quota abolition and calculated the additional WTP of risk-averse dairy farmers in order to cope with milk price volatility. Findings: Using a price series of NZ to approximate milk price volatility after the European dairy quota abolition and comparing it with a German milk price series before quota, the results suggest there might be increased WTP after the milk quota abolition in order to cope with milk price volatility. Following this assumption, the WTP of considerable risk-averse dairy farmers may exceed the initial transaction costs of hedging milk prices with futures on commodity exchanges. Nevertheless, a qualitative discussion of the results shows costs of education, basis risk, and the small size of farms could still keep dairy farmers from hedging the milk price. Originality/value: In calculating the additional WTP for risk-averse dairy farmers to cope with milk price volatility, this is the first study to attempt to illustrate the expected influence of increasing milk price volatility at the dairy farm level after the dairy quota abolition in the EU. The additional WTP gives further insights into the need for and acceptance of insurance after the dairy quota abolition at the dairy farm level. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Little is known about the actual behavior of farmers who are offered forward contracts for renewable resources. The present survey explores farmers' acceptance of sugar beet supply contracts. We find that the farmers' responses are not in line with forecasts that are based on critical prices derived from naïve gross margin comparisons. Instead, farmers take into account that the contractual obligation to supply a certain amount of beets in combination with the volumetric production risk produces an asymmetry in revenues. They also consider risk and dynamic changes of the relative competitiveness of sugar beet and competing crop alternatives. We furthermore find that the past matters: a subsequent improvement of a contract offer that is made after an initial offer has been rejected by farmers finds lower acceptance than an initially better offer.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships among choice of risk management tools, perceived effectiveness of risk management tools, self-reported risk attitude, and farm and farmer characteristics. Design/methodology/approach – A mail survey was used to collect information about utilization of risk management tools, perceived effectiveness of risk management tools, and factors that could influence choice of risk management tools by Illinois farmers. Cluster analysis, one-way ANOVA, x2 tests of independence, and multinomial logistic regression were utilized to detect possible relationships among choice of risk management tools, perceived effectiveness of risk management tools, self-reported risk attitude, and farm and farmer characteristics. Findings – Multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that age and gross farm income (GFI) were the strongest predictors of the risk management tool utilization group to which an individual would be assigned. The number of risk management tools utilized decreased with age but increased with GFI. Neither self-reported risk attitude nor education was a significant independent variable in the multinomial logistic regression model, but both were strongly impacted by age. Younger farmers with higher GFI were the most likely users of hedging. Research limitations/implications – The results of this study provide support for the idea that farmers who are better able to generate revenue are better able to manage risk, but the direction of causality was not investigated. Practical implications – Risk management service providers could benefit from this study as a benchmark for understanding their current and potential farmer clients’ risk management strategies. Originality/value – This study used cluster analysis and multinomial logistic regression to address the complexity of decisions regarding multiple risk management tools. The number of tools utilized by individuals was investigated. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Shawn Cole and Barrett Kirwan discuss the US farmers' hedging behavior by focusing on marketing contracts that allow farmers to lock in a crop's price long before harvest, avoiding price risk. Every year, producers report quantity of each crop put under the marketing contract. Shawn and Barrett rely on information collected by Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) every year from 1999 to 2005. The ARMS data are nationally representative, accounting for over 600,000 farms. There could be fixed-costs associated with hedging. Alternatively, more able farmers may be able to generate higher revenue and also be more able to manage risk. Hedging behavior varies in systematic ways that correspond to standard models of behavior. Education matters, as does farm size and the diversification of the farm. The ARMS data are one of the very few comprehensive, representative data sets that include information about investment, production, and risk management decisions.

AB  - The last 4 decades have seen the transformation of food supply chains from being supply driven to becoming much more closely integrated with consumer demand. With this development, the transaction mechanism in food marketing channels has changed from an open-market mechanism to coordination through the use of contract-supply arrangements between farmers and food processors and retailers. In this article, we assess the interaction of marketing channel members through the use of contracts and its impact on incentives, coordination costs, risk aversion, risk allocation, and risk management strategies. For this purpose we specify a 3-stage principal-agent supply chain model involving producers, wholesalers, retailers, and a futures market. We compare the situation with and without a futures market. The empirical results regarding the Dutch ware potato marketing channel during 1971 to 2003 reveal that as a result of increases in incentives to producers and wholesalers, the coordination costs of the marketing channel decreased significantly, both with and without futures trade. The coordination costs of the marketing channel in the case with a futures market appear to be lower than without futures, demonstrating the informational (i.e., price discovery) role of futures markets.

AU  - Wilson, W.W.

T2  - Agribusiness
AB  - One of the impacts of higher prices along with greater volatility in futures, basis, and spreads is that there is pressure for greater use of cash contracts for grain. There is a wide array of cash contracts with varying terms that pose strategic alternatives for buyers, particularly as they seek to use contracting as an element of risk mitigation. Durum is a crop where many issues and challenges are apparent. Durum is more risky than competing crops with greater price, yield, and quality risk. In contrast to competing crops, futures do not exist, cross hedging is poor, and forward contracting has been used minimally. The purpose of this study is to develop a model to analyze alternative contracting strategies in the case of durum wheat. The authors introduce alternative pricing features, and explore contract terms and analyze them in terms of risk and return to growers using stochastic efficiency with respect to a function. Results indicate that contracts reduce risks to growers, and are preferred to no contracting of durum. In general, the results varied across grower risk aversions.

T2  - Rural Sociology
AB  - The highly volatile auction system in Australia accounts for 85 percent of ex-farm wool sales, with the remainder sold by forward contract, futures, and other hedging methods. In this article, against the background of an extensive literature on price risk strategies, we investigate the behavioral factors associated with producers' adoption of price risk- management strategies (specifically futures and forward contracts) for selling wool. This research presents a behavioral model based on Diffusion of Innovations, the Theory of Reasoned Action, and the Theory of Planned Behavior. We found that the auction system is used as a price risk- management tool because other selling methods are considered more risky. We also report on a curious relationship between risk and complexity in terms of wool producers' intentions to use forward contracts. We explored sociological factors in conjunction with focus-group data in an attempt to understand this relationship. This exercise yielded some interesting findings on the impact that trust, habit, social cohesion, and networks have on decision making in the rural community. The significance of this article lies in its application of core sociological theory in a new research context: the Australian wool industry.

AB  - This paper proposes a marketing strategic approach to commodity futures exchanges to optimise the (hedging) services offered. First, the environment of commodity futures exchanges is examined. Second, the threats and opportunities of commodity futures exchanges are analysed. Our analysis demonstrates that market orientation is an important element in the market strategies of commodity futures exchanges. Our market strategic framework is applied to the Dutch hog futures market. It is concluded that market penetration is an appropriate strategy. Consequently, to identify the variables that distinguish between farmers who initiate futures positions and farmers who do not, we conducted a discriminant analysis on data gathered from 418 Dutch hog farmers. The discriminant analysis shows that latent variables, such as farmers' perceived perfonnance, farmers' reference price and farmers' market orientation, are important discriminating variables. Furthennore, farmers' cash market behaviour (in terms of the frequency of selling in the spot market) is an important discriminating variable as well. The usefulness of these results as input for a penetration policy is demonstrated. © Agricultural Economics Society.

AB  - Due to the low crop insurance participation by grain growers in the Pacific Northwest, the performance of insurance programs and the futures market is assessed in this area. Revenue insurance, combined with the futures and government programs, is identified as the optimal risk management portfolio. Although yield risk level, decision maker’s risk preference, and actuarial fairness of premiums can all affect farmers’ choices, the current subsidy policy is most influential. The varying subsidy levels induce farmers’ subsidy-seeking incentive and suppress the risk-reducing incentive. There is little diversification effect from growing two crops in the rotation instead of one. © 2002, Emerald Group Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Crop insurance and hedging are two risk management strategies used by farmers to manage risk. Using a discrete choice model and farm-level data, this study investigates the factors influencing farmers’ use of hedging and crop insurance as risk management strategies. In the case of crop insurance, results indicate that level of education, participation in other risk management strategies (such as renting land, commodity programs, spreading sales over the year), and controlling debt are positively related to a farmer’s decision to purchase crop insurance. For the hedging model, results suggest education, off-farm income, forward contracting sales of crops and livestock, and computer use are positively related to a farmer’s participation in hedging/futures markets. © 2002, Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.

The model is extended to incorporate futures hedging and the Separation Theorem is used to show that optimal hedging is zero. The assumption of a risk-free asset is relaxed and, while this leads to a violation of the Separation Theorem, the result that optimal hedging is zero is maintained providing that futures markets are efficient. It is concluded that if capital markets are efficient then farmers will have little interest in futures markets except to speculate. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Few cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) producers use futures and options to price their crop despite significant efforts to educate farmers about risk management tools. The purpose of this study is (i) to provide insight on producer use of various marketing strategies, (ii) to determine motivating factors that affect allocation of crop to alternative marketing strategies, and (iii) to analyze share allocation of cotton crop to alternative marketing strategies. Marketing strategies considered in this analysis are cash sales, forward contracting, marketing through pools (cooperatives), and hedging. Data for the study were obtained from the survey of cotton producers conducted in the spring of 2000. Models for share allocations to different strategies are estimated using a seemingly unrelated regression approach. The results of the empirical analysis suggest that hedging with futures and options is positively affected by farm size and leverage and is negatively affected by marketing training, belief in the benefits of pools, and personal marketing preferences. Producers that believe that marketing pools can net them a higher price than they can get themselves are less likely to allocate significant portions of their crop to forward contracting. Allocation of cotton to cash sales is positively affected by government payments and offfarm income and negatively affected by size, belief in the benefits of pools, and perceptions of market efficiency. Share allocation to marketing through pools is positively affected by marketing training, risk aversion, belief in the benefits of pools, and personal marketing preferences, and negatively affected by income from government payments. © The Cotton Foundation 2001.

AB  - The hedging models developed over the last half century are evaluated for their ability to explain the actual hedging behavior of the various economic agents. This evaluation shows a total lack of a reasonable positive model of hedging behavior. While each class of existing models predicts some observed behavior, none is able to predict the broad range of actions that is easily observed in the real world. In this paper I develop such a model and include a plausible and coldly rational economic explanation for why farmers don't hedge at all while merchandisers with identical risk attitudes will fully hedge.

AB  - This research re-evaluates producer risk management decisions regarding the choice of forward pricing strategies when governmentally subsidised crop insurance designs and price supports are available. An analytical model is developed to illustrate the substitution of loan programmes for hedging. In particular, we find that this relationship is conditioned on yield levels. Also, a numerical analysis is conducted that incorporates futures prices, basis and yield variability. Three alternative crop insurance designs are evaluated. Optimal futures hedge ratios are derived for expected utility-maximising soybean farmers. Our results suggest that government programme levels profoundly alter the farmer's optimal strategy. We also find that apparently speculative behaviour is risk-minimising when high loan rates and revenue insurance are combined.

AB  - Extension marketing economists commit substantial resources to outlook and market analysis. Producers demand this information and use it to make production and marketing decisions. This study analyzes responses to a marketing survey of producers and extension marketing economists to discern similarities and differences in their perceptions regarding market timing, futures market efficiency, and risk management. Producer and extension perceptions are consistent with regard to several marketing issues, although they are not always consistent with published research results. Both producers and extension economists disagree that producers will receive a lower average price by forward contracting, and many do not believe hedging reduces risk and lowers expected return. Extension marketing economists rate risk reduction as a less important goal of marketing strategies than do producers.

AB  - This paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of optimal hedging under output price uncertainty. The theoretical analysis is facilitated by exploiting the duality between production and cost while the empirical implementation uses the envelope theorem and the indirect expected utility function. Empirically estimable equations are derived by approximating the indirect expected utility function by a Taylor series approximation. The model is tested by using live cattle data as output while using prices of corn, soybeans, and the feeder cattle as inputs. The results support the theoretical predictions and the evidence shows that live cattle farmers exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion.

We examine the optimal production and hedging decisions by a risk-averse producer. If the producer's state prices are derived from his marginal rates of substitution, an unbiased market forward price is perceived as overpriced and an unbiased market put price as underpriced. Even in this case the full hedging and separation theorems still hold and, contrary to previous literature, there is a hedging role for puts. © 2002 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - American Journal of Agricultural Economics
AB  - In applied agricultural economic research various risk-attitude elicitation techniques are used. Here, we investigate whether risk-attitude measures rooted in the expected utility framework are related to measures rooted in the multi-item scale framework. Using a second-order factor analytical model, and data obtained from personal computer-guided interviews with 373 farmers, we investigate whether the common variance among the (latent) risk-attitude measures can be accounted for by a global risk-attitude construct. We find that the different risk-attitude measures are related, and that the global risk-attitude construct is significantly related to farmers' intention to use futures contracts. Our research suggests that farmers' risk attitude is a higher-order characteristic that cannot be effectively extracted by a single measure.

AB  - We use the classic agency model to derive a time-varying optimal hedge ratio for low-frequency time-series data: the type of data used by crop farmers when deciding about production and about their hedging strategy. Rooted in the classic agency framework, the proposed hedge ratio reflects the context of both the crop farmer's decision and the crop farmer's contractual relationships in the marketing channel. An empirical illustration of the Dutch ware potato sector and its futures market in Amsterdam over the period 1971-2003 reveals that the time-varying optimal hedge ratio decreased from 0.34 in 1971 to 0.24 in 2003. The hedging effectiveness, according to this ratio, is 39%. These estimates conform better with farmers' interest in using futures contracts for hedging purposes than the much higher estimates obtained when price risk minimisation is the only objective considered. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2005.

AB  - Variability in feed prices and crop yields are important sources of risk to dairy farmers. A simulation model of a representative dairy farm was used to evaluate crop insurance and hedging as risk management strategies. These strategies lowered expected net returns but also reduced risk. The preferred set of strategies at lower levels of risk aversion included hedging and crop insurance, although a base scenario in which no risk management strategies are employed was also efficient. The preferred strategy at higher levels of risk aversion was a combination of crop insurance and hedging. -Authors

AB  - The expected utility maximization problem is solved for producers with both price and production uncertainty who have access to both futures and options markets.Introduction of production uncertainty alters the optimal futures and options position and almost always makes it optimal for the producer to purchase put options and to underhedge on the futures market. Simulation results lend support to the practice of hedging the minimum expected yield on the futures market and hedging remaining expected production against downside price risk using put options. The results are strengthened if the producer expects local production to influence national prices and if risk aversion is higher at low income levels. © 1993 American Agricultural Economics Association.

AB  - This paper deals with the producer's optimal use of commodity futures in hedging. The framework for analysis is an intertemporal consumption and investment model. The producer makes his production decisions at the beginning of the period and realizes his return at the end of the time interval. During the period, he faces both price and output uncertainties. In applying stochastic dynamic programming methods, this paper shows the effect of these risks on his consumption behavior. Further, the paper investigates his optimal hedging positions in the futures market over time and his optimal production decisions. Finally, implications of these results on the futures markets are discussed. 1984 The American Finance Association

AB  - Although agricultural futures markets offer a number of potential benefits to users, the extent of trade involvemen in UK futures markets has been less than in comparable markets in the United States. This does not appear to be due to poorer hedging performance. An investigation into patterns of use of the London Potato Futures market suggests that nonusers, and to a lesser extent past users, have negative perceptions of futures trading and it is argued that this operates as a barrier to the more extensive use of futures markets among farmers and merchants. © 1992 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - A probit model is used to quantify factors influencing the probability that a selected group of agricultural decision makers (producers and landowners receiving crops from a share lease) used futures or options for commodity marketing during the 1986, 1987, or 1988 marketing years. Respondents were selected from participants in orientation sessions associated with the nationwide Futures and Option Marketing Pilot Program. Results suggest previous use of cash forward contracts, location, size and farming operation (measured by gross farm sales), having a college degree(s), and membership in a marketing club have the greatest impact on the probability of using futures and options.

AB  - A survey of 'top' wheat farmers in 12 counties in western Nebraska was undertaken to help guide future research and extension programs (in agricultural meteorology and economics) in the region. One hundred forty-two farmers (59 percent of those receiving questionnaires) responded to the survey. Of the respondents, 42 percent own or are considering purchasing a personal computer; the vast majority of farmers own a rain gage and some form of temperature-measuring device; the respondents were moderately familiar with an existing Automated Weather Data Network in Nebraska; commercial and NOAA weather radio and commercial television are the main sources of weather data and information; short-term weather forecasts (1 day and 3-5 days) are most important to overall farm planning; respondents considered market and cost-of-production information and more-accurate weather forecasts most important in better management of their farm operations; the risk factors that impacted farm net income were economic followed by weather factors and marketing decisions; and most farmers would be willing to forward contract before the crop was half developed if good projections of crop status and yield could be made. A major constraint to preharvest forward contracting from some of the farmers' perspective appears to be variability in yield due to hail. -Authors

AB  - This paper analyzes the optimal production and hedging decisions for firms facing futures price, basis and production risk, assuming futures and options can be used. Using CARA (constant absolute risk aversion) utility and normal distributions, we derive an exact solution and show that joint production and price risk lead to a hedging role for options. Risk averse firms that can use each hedging instrument will generally have higher (expected) output. Using Iowa data for soybeans, the parameters of the joint distribution of future prices, cash prices and yields are estimated and the results are used to approximate optimal hedging decisions for soybean producers.

AB  - The problem of choice among risk-management strategies is addressed with the stochastic dominance with a risk-free asset (SDRA) criteria. The SDRA criteria consider all possible combinations of the strategies and financial leverage. This allows for strategies with less business risk, less expected return, and greater leverage to dominate strategies with greater business risk and greater expected return. Results show that the inclusion of the risk-free asset significantly improves the discriminatory power of the ordinary stochastic dominance criteria for the case of risk-management strategies.

TI  - PRODUCTION ORGANIZATION AND RISK CONTROL WHEN MARKET INSTRUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE
AU  - BOWDEN, RJ
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - A standard result in the theory of production under price risk is that if forward cover is available, production is determined in terms of the known, quoted forward or futures price, rather than expectations of future prices. In practice, however, primary production often involves joint or substitutable products, so that a natural hedge may be available. In addition, costs such as input prices or interest rates are highly variable and may be correlated with output prices. Supply risk adds to this variation. This paper considers the demand for market-based hedging instruments in relation to such natural hedges and to the possible use of storage for hedging purposes. Under normality of conditional price/cost variation it is shown that for relatively arbitrary nonlinear production technologies and attitudes to risk, producers can plan production and derive their demand for futures by decomposing the organisation into a number of activity centres, involving planning, marketing, cost, and treasury functions. Adding up the hedging demands from each centre, and equating to the effective supply of each type of hedge (natural and market), yields a linear system that may be solved for the optimum quantities of each hedge contract.

AB  - This article examines the hedging properties of Atlantic salmon futures. Hedging is important because it allows for mitigation of the risk of adverse price changes in the spot market. We examine the hedging efficiency of three types of hedging strategies; unhedged, fully hedged and hedging using optimal hedging ratios. To find the optimal hedge ratio we use an estimated constant hedge ratio, optimal hedge ratios estimated with rolling 20-week and 52-week windows, and bivariate GARCH models. The results provide evidence that hedging using futures contracts listed on Fish Pool reduces risk for producers of farmed Atlantic salmon. The best hedging efficiency is achieved with a simple one-to-one hedge, closely followed by the bivariate GARCH approach.

AB  - The interaction of alternative insurance designs with futures hedging and the purchase of options is examined in this article. A numerical analysis is conducted using a revenue simulation model that incorporates futures prices, basis, and yield variability. Four alternative yield and revenue crop insurance designs are evaluated. Optimal futures and at-the-money put option hedge ratios are derived for expected utility maximizing cotton and soybean producers. Our findings indicate that the alternative insurance designs do influence forward pricing levels. Alternative behavioral assumptions are shown to influence the optimal hedge. Also, yield insurance generally compliments forward pricing while pure revenue insurance generally has a negative effect. Other insurance designs currently offered have an effect on the optimal hedge that falls between the two extremes of yield insurance and pure revenue insurance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

T2  - GERMAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Futures contracts are extensively used by commercial market participants to hedge commodities against the risk of adverse price fluctuations. But although farmers have faced increased volatility in commodity prices in recent years, only very few of them actively use hedging as a risk management instrument. In this article we analyze the hedging potential of the Euronext milling wheat futures market for German farmers based on the estimation of optimal static as well as optimal dynamic hedge ratios. We find that both hedging approximately one year and half a year before harvesting leads to a reduction in the variance of returns compared with unhedged portfolios. But this risk minimization is achieved at the cost of lower returns on average. In addition we find that margin calls might be one of the reasons why so few farmers hedge since they cause liquidity problems especially in marketing years with unanticipated price shocks.

AB  - Two major approaches to measuring risk attitude are compared. One, based on the expected I utility model is derived from responses to lotteries and direct scaling. The other measure is a psychometric approach based on Likert statements that produces a unidimensional risk attitude scale. The data are from computer-assisted interviews of 346 Dutch owner-managers of hog farms, who made decisions about their own businesses. While the measures demonstrate some degree of convergent validity, those measures based on lotteries were better predictors of actual market behavior. In contrast the psychometric scale showed more agreement to self-reported measures of innovativeness, market orientation, and the intention to reduce risk. In light of the higher predictive validity of lottery-based measurements, we recommend elicitation methods based on the expected utility paradigm.

AB  - The impact of skewness in the hedger's objective function is tested using a model of hedging derived from a third-order Taylor Series approximation of expected utility. To determine the effect of price skewness upon hedging and speculation, analytical results are derived using an example of cotton storage. Findings suggest that when forward risk premiums and price skewness in the spot asset have opposite signs, speculation increases relative to the mean-variance model. When the signs are identical, speculation will decrease, contradicting findings of mean-variance models. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
